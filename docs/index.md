# TwPM documentation

## About

Trust**worthy** Platform Module project aims to increase the trustworthiness of
the traditional
[TPM module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module)
(hence the T**w**PM), by providing the open-source firmware implementation for
the TPM device,
[compliant to the TCG PC Client Specification](explanation/compliance.md).

The main goal of the project is an attempt to create open-source firmware stack,
implementing the TCG PC Client Platform TPM Profile specification. Project aims
to use already available open-source software components whenever possible
(such as TPM simulators for TPM commands handling), while developing new code
when necessary (such as LPC FPGA module, or low-level TPM FIFO interface
handling).

Another challenge is to overcome hardware restrictions and allow users to use
the open-source TPM implementation on generally-accessible development boards.

## Community

TwPM project is a project of the Dasharo community. Itâ€™s an open-source project
that welcomes community contributions, suggestions, fixes, and other form
of feedback.
